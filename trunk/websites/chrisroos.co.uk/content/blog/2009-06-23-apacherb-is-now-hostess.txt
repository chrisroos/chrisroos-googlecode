  A little while ago I wrote about a utility called "apacherb":/blog/2008-12-15-a-utility-to-manage-apache-virtual-hosts-on-a-mac-like-the-passenger-pref-pane-but-for-simple-static-sites.  It took the concept of the "passenger preference pane":http://www.fngtps.com/2008/06/putting-the-pane-back-into-deployment and applied it to any local directory (rather than specifically rails apps).  I'd always meant to turn the utility into a "gem":http://rubygems.org/ but never quite got round to it.  Luckily, "James Adam":http://interblah.net/ moved the code to "github":http://github.com/lazyatom/hostess/tree/master, tidied it a little (notably making it restart apache after a change), renamed it and gemifimibulated it.
  
  Install it with:
  
  <pre class="code shell">
  $ gem install hostess
  </pre>
  
  Executing it without any arguments will display some simple instructions.
  
  <pre class="code shell">
  $ hostess
    Usage:
      hostess create domain directory - create a new virtual host
      hostess delete domain           - delete a virtual host
      hostess list                    - list hostess virtual hosts
      hostess help                    - this info
  </pre>
      
  You'll need to run it as "sudo":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo as it writes the configuration into /etc/apache2 and restarts apache.
  
  To create a domain pointing at a local directory, you'd do something like:
  
  <pre class="code shell">
  $ sudo hostess create example.local ~/Sites/example.local/
  </pre>
  
  This will register the local domain (the .local suffix is a convention rather than a rule) using "directory services":http://developer.apple.com/opensource/dirservices/ and add the "apache":http://httpd.apache.org/ "virtual host":http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/vhosts/.  Open your browser and visit example.local to see your local site.  Good huh.
