  It bugs me when I'm unable to cancel accounts I have for various online services.  I guess that I've possibly become annoyed by it because lots of the "more":http://www.backpackit.com "recent":http://www.basecamphq.com ("cool":http://www.blinksale.com) "offerings":http://www.strongspace.com make it very easy to cancel.

  I was initially aiming this rant at "yahoo":http://www.yahoo.com as I've had a user there for about seven years (hmm, that seems too long but I'm pretty certain it's correct) and didn't think I could cancel it.  It would actually appear that I can cancel it but they still make it relatively difficult to do (go to help, click on article, follow link and then cancel).

  Actually, I just changed the title of the post from *I should be able to close online accounts* to it's present form due to the yahoo finding (although I'm pretty certain there are lots of other services that don't allow for cancelling).
