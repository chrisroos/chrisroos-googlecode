  div(notice). I've finally got around to updating this utility.  See "this later post":/blog/2009-11-17-converting-egg-statements-and-transactions-to-ofx for more details.
  
  I've cobbled together some pretty nasty code to convert an "Egg":http://www.egg.com Credit Card statement to "Ofx":http://www.ofx.net.

  Grab the "source":http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/egg-ofx/ from "google code":http://code.google.com.

  <pre class="code shell">
  $ svn checkout http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/egg-ofx
  </pre>

  As well as requiring "hpricot":http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/hpricot/, you will need to edit the StatementsFolder and OfxOutputFolder variables in egg.rb.  These need to point to a directory containing html statements, and an empty output directory respectively.

  I've used the script to upload my last 12 statements to "wesabe":http://www.wesabe.com and everything seems to work Ok. If you have any questions, just post a comment here.
