  This is obviously completely optional but if anyone stumbles across this post, I'd really appreciate it if you'd spend a few minutes checking out the revised "reevoo.com":http://www.reevoo.com.

  I don't want to say too much as I want to influence any judgement.  Just check it out and let me know what you think, either in the comments here or by "email":mailto:chrisroos@reevoo.com.  Oh, and really don't be scared to slag it off, praise it up or just sit on the fence - any opinion is welcome.

  Oh, and in case it's not obvious, I work at Reevoo.
