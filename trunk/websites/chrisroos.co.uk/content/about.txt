  h1. #{h(@page.title)}

  Although heavily influenced by my "begging for a job":/blog/2008-12-17-please-sir-can-i-have-a-job post I intend to keep this up to date so I don't feel too bad about replicating it here.

  h2. Employment
  
  h3. Currently
  
  * I currently work at "Go Free Range":http://gofreerange.com
  
  h3. Previously
  
  * Software developer at "Headshift":http://www.headshift.com for about 18 months
  * Software developer at "reevoo.com":http://www.reevoo.com for about 3 years
  * Unsuccessfully attempted to work for myself for about a year
  * Software developer at "Tempest Technology":http://www.tempest-technology.com/ for about 3 years

  h2. Skills

  * "Ruby":http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/.  A splendid little language.
  * "Rails":http://www.rubyonrails.org/.  Although I started using Rails in August 2005, I've definitely missed out on some of the more recent changes.
  * "Javascript":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript.  Should only be used to enhance existing functionality and should (probably) never be _required_ for a site.
  * "HTML":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML.  I love clean and semantically marked up HTML.
  * "CSS":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets.  I'm not brilliant with CSS and although I can get reasonable results it'll take me longer than it would someone that really knows their stuff.
  * "Pair Programming":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming.  I prefer to pair program, particularly on production code.
  * "Testing":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing.  I pretty much struggle to do anything if I'm unable to test it in some way.  I've not really bought into anything like "rspec":http://rspec.info/ and "test/unit":http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/test/unit/rdoc/ is still my tool of choice.

  h2. Desired working environment

  * I want to work with smart people.
  * I want to work on software that has a purpose I believe in.
  * I want to work somewhere that I'm able to question decisions and have my questions listened to.
  * I want to work with open source software.
  * I want to contribute back to the open source community.

  h2. Likes

  * Simple solutions ("apache":http://httpd.apache.org/ and "webby":http://webby.rubyforge.org/ over a rails app, for example).
  * Learning and sharing knowledge.
  * Prioritising by always working on the next most important thing.
  * Helping people through technology.
  * The disruptive nature of technology.
  * "My Society":http://www.mysociety.org/.  I love the stuff that these guys do.
  * Transparency in business.
  * "Permalinks":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permalink that are actually, you know, permanent.
  * "HTTP":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP.  I love the simplicity and power of this ubiquitous protocol.

  h2. Dislikes

  * "SEO":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization. In my opinion, it's as simple as doing the right thing (follow web standards, provide something useful and think about the user).
  * Websites that don't get the web ("activeplaces.com":http://activeplaces.com, "nationalrail.co.uk":http://nationalrail.co.uk)
  * Websites that are poorly marked up, therefore making scraping them hard :-) (particularly bank websites)
  * Marketing shite.  Surely we're all grown up enough to speak to each other as people, aren't we?

  h2. Location

  "Ramsgate":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsgate in "Kent":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent in the "UK":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom
