  Very naive Ruby method to create a "MicroId":http://www.microid.org for a given email and url.

  <pre class="code ruby">
  require 'digest/sha1'

  def micro_id(email, url)
    email_digest = Digest::SHA1.new(email).to_s
    url_digest = Digest::SHA1.new(url).to_s
    Digest::SHA1.new(email_digest + url_digest).to_s
  end
  </pre>

  Note that there is no validation of the MicroId in this code at all.
