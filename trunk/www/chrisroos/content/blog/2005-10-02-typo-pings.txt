  I updated Typo last night to run from svn trunk, just to get the added benefit of pinging sites like "weblogs":http://www.weblogs.com and "technorati":http://www.technorati.com whenever I publish an article.  All was running smoothly until I just tried to create the newsreader article.  On saving, I get a not very helpful Rails app error.  The logs didn't help an amazing amount either...

  It was at around this point that I remembered that my shared hosting account didn't actually allow for certain low level network access (e.g. ICMP(Internet Control Message Protocol)) from my virtual machine.  Sure enough, disabling the auto-ping option made the error go away.  Having looked a bit further it would appear that the articles were actually being saved but I was seeing the error when the ping request was timing out.  This has already been reported on "typo trac":http://typo.leetsoft.com/trac/ticket/400.  I must admit I don't know the exact cause of the problem here but am guessing that the blog ping's require access to some network operation that I don't have permissions for...

  Mmmm, seems I was being stupid in my assumption.  The 'blog pings' just transfer data over http, nothing lower than that.  As such, the problem must have been caused by a non-respondent ping server at the time I was trying to save.  In fact, I just created a new test article and enabled the pings and all worked fine.  Oops.
