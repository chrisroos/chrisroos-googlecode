  A bit of an unordered list of features I'd like to see in a feed reader.  It's very possible these exist in some readers that I'm not aware of (I've moved from "desktop app on windows":http://www.sharpreader.net/ through "bloglines":http://bloglines.com/ and "rojo":http://www.rojo.com to "feedshow":http://www.feedshow.com).

  * Comment from within the reader.  This would then automatically subscribe to a feed of the comments so that I could poll the updates.

  * Notify me when feeds haven't been accessible for a while.  Maybe the address has changed or the reader cannot interpret the feed correctly; either way, I'd like to know so that I can make an informed decision about what to do.

  * When a page offers multiple feed formats, I don't want to be asked what format to subscribe to.  The program should know the format it supports best and choose that.  As I type this, I'm thinking that this is more difficult if there is a choice between full and summary content.

  * If an existing article is 'refreshed' then diff it.  If it hasn't changed then I don't want to see it.  If it has changed, then highlight the changes for me.

  * Show html in articles sensibly (rojo seemed to fail miserably on this front).

  * Host a 'live' (i.e. dynamically generated copy of my feeds in opml) - I can't think of any reason to have to import/export these.
