  Hitting the database in testing is bad.

  Something that I've found relatively useful at "work":http://www.reevoo.com is to use real "Active Record":http://api.rubyonrails.com/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html objects without any persistence (basically use AR#new and not AR#save[!] or AR#create[!]).  When using standard techniques to create the association objects in memory you only get one side of the association at a time.  Consider the following.

  <pre class="code ruby">
  class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :addresses
  end
  class Address < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :person
  end

  # One sided relationship with parent getting access to child
  chris = Person.new
  home = chris.addresses.build

  chris.addresses.first
  => #<home>
  home.person
  => nil

  # One sided relationship with child getting access to parent
  home = Address.new
  chris = home.build_person

  chris.addresses
  => []
  home.person
  => #<chris>

  # The example above that creates the address first could also have been written as.
  # chris = Person.new
  # home = Address.new(:person => chris)
  </pre>

  You can see that in each case, only one side of the relationship has access to the other.  If we were persisting the objects then the relationship would be two way via a database lookup.  We can get a two way relationship in memory; although it has a certain duplication smell about it.  Assuming the same models as above, we can amend the above examples like so.

  <pre class="code ruby">
  # First example
  chris = Person.new
  home = chris.addresses.build(:person => chris)

  chris.addresses.first
  => #<home>
  home.person
  => #<chris>

  # Second example
  home = Address.new
  chris = home.build_person(:addresses => [home])

  home.person
  => #<chris>
  chris.addresses.first
  => #<home>
  </pre>

  I've occasionally used this in place of stubbing methods but am still not 100% convinced of the definite benefits one way or another.  I do have some definite disadvantages of stubbing methods (nothing exciting, they've almost certainly been noted by many others in the past) which I'll note down at a later date.
