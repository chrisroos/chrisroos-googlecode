  I've been using the reminders feature of "backpack":http://www.backpackit.com to text me when I need to be doing something time specific.  As per "this":http://www.backpackit.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=16 thread in the forum, although I get the text messages, there is no subject; meaning I have to remember what it was that I wanted to be reminded about.  Hmmm.

  Following the advice from that thread, I just set-up a forwarding rule on my "email providers":http://www.fastmail.fm server to forward reminder alerts from backpack to my orange account.  This is in place of getting backpack to send directly to my orange email.  I now get the subjects in my text messages as expected.  Yay.
