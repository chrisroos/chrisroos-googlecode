  I have three minor outstanding issues with a recent sky installation.  Not wanting to phone them (as previous experience suggests that it's going to waste a lot of my life) I thought I'd drop them an email.

  Uh oh.  Looks like they don't want my email.

  bq. "The highlighted field above has an invalid value.  Please correct it.
  Please make sure that no more than 500 characters have been entered in this field."

  So now, not only have I wasted time waiting for their website to time out while signing up, but I've also wasted time filling in a useless feedback form, taking a screenshot and even blogging about it.  Oh, and I'm still going to have to speak to someone.  Brilliant.
