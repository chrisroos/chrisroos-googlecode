  I found that on several occasions I've wanted to create a hash that increments the number of instances of a given key.  We could do something manual like.

  <pre class="code ruby">
  hash = Hash.new
  def increment_count(hash, key)
    hash[key] ||= 0 # Sets any new keys to 0.
    hash[key] += 1
  end
  </pre>

  This is fine; but can be written more concisely.  If we supply an object to Hash::new then that object becomes the default value for all missing keys in the hash.  The above example is shortened by one line.

  <pre class="code ruby">
  hash = Hash.new(0)
  def increment_count(hash, key)
    hash[key] += 1
  end
  </pre>

  A problem arises when we want to use an object that isn't immutable (in this case, basically anything other than a Fixnum) as the default value.  The example that I came across a couple of times today was using an empty array as the default value.  If we try to use the same method as above, we experience problems.

  <pre class="code ruby">
  hash = Hash.new(Array.new)
  hash[:key_one]
  => []
  hash[:key_two] << 99
  => [99]
  hash[:key_one]
  => [99] # is actually the same array amended in the step above
  </pre>

  I've known that there was a way around this for a long time but have never bothered to look it up.  I finally got round to looking at it today, and it is, unsurprisingly, very simple.  We supply the hash constructor with a block.  This block is called for any missing key and supplied with the hash and said key.  The example above becomes.

  <pre class="code ruby">
  hash = Hash.new { |hash, key| hash[key] = Array.new }
  hash[:key_one]
  => []
  hash[:key_two] << 99
  => [99]
  hash[:key_one]
  => []
  </pre>

  I say I looked it up today but to be fair there's every chance that I was well aware of this at some point in the past...
