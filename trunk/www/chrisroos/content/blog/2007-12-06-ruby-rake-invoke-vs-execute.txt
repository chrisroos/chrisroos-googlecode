  First up - I don't know an awful lot about the magic that is "Rake":http://rake.rubyforge.org/.  As such, this is probably common knowledge to most people.

  I discovered the difference when trying to execute the db:migrate task from within another rake task (I already knew it worked when declared as a dependency).

  <pre class="code ruby">
  # Rakefile
  task :foo do
    Rake::Task['db:migrate'].execute
  end

  #$ rake foo
  #=> rake aborted!
  #=> uninitialized constant ActiveRecord
  </pre>

  I changed "Task#execute":http://rake.rubyforge.org/classes/Rake/Task.html#M000100 to "Task#invoke":http://rake.rubyforge.org/classes/Rake/Task.html#M000098 and, voila, it all worked fine.  The rdoc for those methods is actually pretty self explanatory, having seen the differences in action.  Oh well.

  I put together a simple example to demonstrate the differences.

  <pre class="code ruby">
  # The task (task_1) and its dependency (to_be_run_before_task_1)

  task :to_be_run_before_task_1 do
    puts "to_be_run_before_task_1"
  end

  task :task_1 => ['to_be_run_before_task_1'] do
    puts "task_1"
  end

  # Three tasks that 'run' task_1

  task :invoke_task_1 do
    Rake::Task['task_1'].invoke
  end

  task :execute_task_1 do
    Rake::Task['task_1'].execute
  end

  task :run_task_1_using_dependencies => ['task_1']

  # 'Running' the tasks

  #$ rake task_1
  #=> to_be_run_before_task_1
  #=> task_1

  #$ rake invoke_task_1
  #=> to_be_run_before_task_1
  #=> task_1

  #$ rake execute_task_1
  #=> task_1 #*** Note that the dependencies are not run

  #$ rake run_task_1_using_dependencies
  #=> to_be_run_before_task_1
  #=> task_1
  </pre>
