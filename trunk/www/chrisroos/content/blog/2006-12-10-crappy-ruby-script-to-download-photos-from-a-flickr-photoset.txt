  So, it seems far more difficult than it should be to retrieve a bunch of *my* photos from flickr.com.  Having unsuccessfully experimented with some of the flickr libs on "rubyforge":http://www.rubyforge.org I hacked this together.

  *UPDATE*: Something caused curl to get 'stuck' downloading a particular picture so I amended the script to ensure it ignores already downloaded files.

  *UPDATE 2*: Surround output filename with quotes.

  <pre class="code ruby">
  require 'cgi'

  API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
  PHOTOSET_ID = 'YOUR_PHOTOSET_ID'
  LOCAL_PHOTO_DIR = '/users/chrisroos/desktop/photos/'

  curl_cmd = %[curl "http://api.flickr.com/services/rest/?method=flickr.photosets.getPhotos&api_key=\#{API_KEY}&photoset_id=\#{PHOTOSET_ID}"]
  photoset_photos = `\#{curl_cmd}`

  number_of_photos = photoset_photos.scan(/<photo .*>/).size
  current_photo = 0

  photoset_photos.scan(/<photo .*>/) do |line|
    current_photo += 1

    photo_id = line[/id="(\d+)"/, 1]
    photo_secret = line[/secret="(\w+)"/, 1]
    photo_server = line[/server="(\d+)"/, 1]
    photo_title = line[/title="(.+?)"/, 1]

    url = "http://static.flickr.com/\#{photo_server}/\#{photo_id}_\#{photo_secret}_o_d.jpg"
    filename = CGI.unescapeHTML(photo_title).gsub(/ |&|,|-/, '_').gsub(/'/, '').downcase.squeeze('_') + '_' + photo_id + '.jpg' # Sanitize title to use as filename
    filepath = LOCAL_PHOTO_DIR + filename

    if File.exists?(filepath)
      puts "Skipping photo (already downloaded) \#{current_photo} of \#{number_of_photos}"
    else
      puts "Retrieving photo \#{current_photo} of \#{number_of_photos}"
      curl_cmd = %[curl "\#{url}" > "\#{filepath}"]
      `\#{curl_cmd}`
    end
  end
  </pre>
