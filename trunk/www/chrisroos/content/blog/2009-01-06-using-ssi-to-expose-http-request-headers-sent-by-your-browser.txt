  Playing around with my "T-Mobile G1":http://www.t-mobile.co.uk/g1-with-google-phone/ made me wonder what the included web browser was.  I knew that I needed a site that would display the "http request headers":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_headers#Requests and through the magic of google happened upon "Andy Langton's":http://andylangton.co.uk "check browser headers":http://andylangton.co.uk/online-tools/check-browser-headers utility.  This did the job and let me know that the browser is some kind of mobile safari client built on "webkit":http://webkit.org/.

  That was all well and good but I started to wonder whether I could create an equivalent page without having to resort to a scripting language.  It turns out that I could use "Server Side Includes":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Side_Includes to do just that.  I had a couple of reasons to reinvent this particular wheel: a) to satisfy myself that I could do such a thing in a very short time, and b) to make the output as clear as possible.  The clarity thing is a big deal for me, I often find myself asking google for my "IP":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address only to follow a link to a page that contains my IP buried in a lot of noise (adverts, unnecessary text and lots of links).  I appreciate that Andy's utility doesn't contain any advertising but it still has some noise in the form of the blog template.  So, without further ado, I present my own little utility to "display http request headers":/utilities/http-request-headers/.
