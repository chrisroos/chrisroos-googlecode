  Using the data supplied in this "article":http://postcodes.easypeasy.com, by "Nik Sargent":http://www.niksargent.com, I've created a simple web service that returns "JSON":http://www.json.org formatted data about UK Outcodes (the first bit of the postcode).

  The idea is that you can request, for example, /postcodes/se1 and get some json in return.  For se1, we receive the following data.

  <pre class="code javascript">
  {"latitude":"51.498","x":"532600","postcode":"SE1","y":"179500","longitude":"51.498"}
  </pre>

  The service is currently running at "http://seagul.co.uk/postcodes":http://seagul.co.uk/postcodes ("se1":http://seagul.co.uk/postcodes/se1) but I make no guarantees as to its reliability.  I'd suggest that if anyone actually finds this useful that they go host it somewhere for themselves in order to control the availability.

  The code is, as always, on "google code":http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/uk-postcodes/ and pasted below.

  I've created it as a proof of concept but I figure that, given a little love, it may prove useful to some folks.

  <pre class="code ruby">
  require 'rubygems'
  require 'mongrel'
  require 'json'

  postcodes_file = File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/uk-postcodes.json'
  Postcodes = JSON.parse(File.open(postcodes_file) { |f| f.read })
  Index = Postcodes.inject([]) { |index, postcode| index << postcode['postcode'].downcase }

  class PostcodeHandler < Mongrel::HttpHandler
    def process(request, response)
      outcode = request.params['PATH_INFO'].sub(/^\//, '').downcase
      postcode_index = Index.index(outcode)
      if postcode_index
        response.start do |head, out|
          head["Content-Type"] = "text/plain"
          out << Postcodes[postcode_index].to_json
        end
      else
        response.start(404) do |head,out|
          out << "Postcode not found\n"
        end
      end
    end
  end

  config = Mongrel::Configurator.new :host => 'localhost', :port => '4000' do
    listener do
      uri "/postcodes", :handler => PostcodeHandler.new
    end
    trap("INT") { stop }
    run
  end

  config.join
  </pre>
