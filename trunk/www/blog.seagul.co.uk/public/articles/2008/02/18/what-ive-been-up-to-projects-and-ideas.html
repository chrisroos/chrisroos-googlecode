              </p>
          
              <p>I&#8217;ve been a bit quiet on the blogging front (to be fair, I&#8217;ve always been a bit slack) but I think it&#8217;s for good reason: I&#8217;ve re-discovered a love for programming, and in particular, creating things that I (and hopefully others) find useful.</p>


	<p>So, as a bit of an update, and a bit of a reminder for me, I thought I&#8217;d list all the things I&#8217;m either working on or thinking about.  Feel free to ask questions in the comments or by emailing me (chris at this domain).</p>


	<h2>Projects</h2>


	<h3>Atom (like <span class="caps">RSS</span>) feed for thisiskent news content</h3>


	<p>I&#8217;m interested in reading news articles from the local area but the <a href="http://www.thisiskent.co.uk">thisiskent website</a> doesn&#8217;t provide a feed for me to subscribe to.  I&#8217;ve created a little project that scrapes the news content from that site and produces a feed.  The feed is currently at <a href="http://seagul.co.uk/thisiskent-thanet.atom">http://seagul.co.uk/thisiskent-thanet.atom</a> but will possibly move in the future.</p>


	<h3>The Local Paper</h3>


	<p>I wanted to give each article, in our local papers, a permalink so that people had a way to reference an article they were talking about.  I&#8217;ve started building the site over at <a href="http://the-local-paper.co.uk">http://the-local-paper.co.uk</a>.  There&#8217;s a long way to go but I really wanted to start getting some content up so that I had more incentive to continue.</p>

	<h3>Sending trackbacks to pages that I bookmark in <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a></h3>


	<p>I asked for this a while back in the <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ydn-delicious/message/1447">del.icio.us group</a>.  It occurred to me that I could add the functionality myself to the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3615">del.icio.us firefox extension</a>, so I did.  It&#8217;s more of a proof of concept at the moment but you can follow <a href="/articles/2008/02/04/sending-trackbacks-to-the-sites-that-you-bookmark-in-del-icio-us">these instructions</a> if you wish to try it out.</p>

	<h3>Adding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permalink">permalinks</a> to del.icio.us bookmarks</h3>


	<p>This was the precursor to the trackbacks project above.  I&#8217;ve created a firefox extension that, building on the del.icio.us extension, adds a &#8216;permalink tag&#8217; to each bookmark you create.  You can read more <a href="/articles/2007/12/18/extracting-my-del-icio-us-permalinks-functionality-into-its-own-firefox-extension">here</a> or visit the <a href="http://delicious-permalinks.googlegroups.com/web/installation.html">installation page</a> to install the extension.</p>

	<h3>Some blogging software</h3>


	<p>I decided that I really didn&#8217;t need the overhead of <a href="http://www.typosphere.org/">typo</a> to produce what is essentially a static site.  The result is some software that produces the website that you&#8217;re reading now.  I actually need to get some work done on this because I&#8217;m currently in a position where it&#8217;s harder for me to add content now than it used to be with typo.  D&#8217;oh.</p>

	<h3>An <span class="caps">SMS</span> service to lookup train information</h3>


	<p>I&#8217;ve built a service on top of <a href="http://www.twitter.com">twitter</a> that allows you to request departure information.  This is actually live now (read the <a href="/articles/2007/07/24/train-times-by-sms-or-improving-national-rail-enquiries">instructions</a>) but could be a lot more useful.  I&#8217;ve found that my main use case is to find the next few trains from a specific station within the next half hour or so &#8211; I&#8217;m hoping to make the interface better suit this need.</p>

	<h3>Software to interface with banking websites and download/convert the data to <a href="http://www.ofx.net/"><span class="caps">OFX</span></a> (for upload to <a href="http://www.wesabe.com">wesabe</a>)</h3>


	<p>A while back, I got quite addicted to using wesabe in an attempt to manage my finances (as it happens I&#8217;ve been very slack on this front too &#8211; managing money is just boring).  I wrote some scripts to download data from my banks&#8217; websites and additionally to convert that data to <span class="caps">OFX</span>.</p>

	<h3>A ruby implementation of <a href="http://www.pwdhash.com">pwdhash</a></h3>


	<p>I wanted a command line version of the pwdhash tool.  I knocked up a ruby implementation but haven&#8217;t really got round to making it command line friendly.</p>

	<h3>A web service that converts a UK postcode to Latitude/Longitude</h3>


	<p>It currently lives at <a href="http://seagul.co.uk/postcodes">http://seagul.co.uk/postcodes</a>.</p>

	<h2>Ideas</h2>


	<h3>A del.icio.us extension that mines del.icio.us (and magnolia etc) to find similar sites to those that I&#8217;m looking at</h3>


	<p>I did a fair bit of investigation into this, although I&#8217;m not sure any of it is of any real use.  I was working on the theory that if the page I&#8217;m looking at is tagged with, for example, &#8216;train&#8217;, &#8216;uk&#8217; and &#8216;travel&#8217; then other pages tagged in the same way would probably also be of interest.  Check the <a href="http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/delicious_similar_sites">delicious_similar_sites</a> and <a href="http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/delicious-sidebar">delicious-sidebar</a> projects to check my progress.</p>

	<h3>A hosted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trackback">trackback</a> / <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pingback">pingback</a> service</h3>


	<p>I&#8217;m thinking of something like <a href="http://www.disqus.com">disqus</a> (hosted comments service) but for trackbacks/pingbacks.  I did find a site called <a href="http://www.trackbackr.com">trackbackr</a> that would appear to offer something similar but I haven&#8217;t looked into it in any detail.</p>


	<h3>A hosted redirection service</h3>


	<p>I want an easy way to create short/friendly URLs for a domain that I own.  I&#8217;ve started exploring the possibility of a RESTful service to do just this.  There&#8217;s some initial code over on <a href="http://chrisroos.co.uk/code/mongrel-redirection">google code</a></p>

	<h3>A mobile friendly version of the <a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk">National Rail Enquiries</a> website</h3>


	<p>I need to check whether this is already covered by the <a href="http://www.traintimes.org.uk">accessible national rails</a> website.</p>


	<h3>An <span class="caps">SMS</span> alert with train information</h3>


	<p>For three mornings a week, I get a regular train.  I&#8217;d like to receive a text message, half an hour (or so) before I leave house, that tells me whether the train is running on time.</p>


	<h3>A receipt tagging application (del.icio.us for receipts)</h3>


	<p>Until recently I had a lot of receipts stored on my email server.  This didn&#8217;t feel like the right place for them so I&#8217;ve placed them all on my laptop, in a folder that gets backed up to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3">Amazon S3</a> with the help of <a href="http://jungledisk.com">jungledisk</a>.  I&#8217;d like to be able to tag these receipts to make retrieval easier.  Ooh, I just had a thought &#8211; I wonder if I could just bookmark their <span class="caps">S3 URL</span> in del.icio.us&#8230;</p>


	<h3>Some software to track my unsubscriptions</h3>


	<p>Marketing emails annoy me.  I almost certainly don&#8217;t want them.  More importantly, when I state that I don&#8217;t want them, I want to have my wishes respected.  I knew that I was getting emails from companies that I&#8217;d unsubscribed from and wanted to track the offenders.  I&#8217;ve been using the <a href="http://www.stikipad.com">stikipad</a> wiki to do this but it&#8217;s not exactly ideal.  I&#8217;d like a service that will collect these emails (I&#8217;m thinking that I&#8217;ll forward them straight there) and report on those naughty companies that keep spamming me.</p>

	<h3>A firefox extension/<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748">greasemonkey</a> script to determine the canonical <span class="caps">URL</span> of a resource</h3>


	<p>At one stage I was trying to use del.icio.us to manage the stuff I had for sale on <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk">ebay</a>.  Unfortunately, ebay is a bit naughty with their URLs (the same item for sale is available at different URLs) which meant I could end up bookmarking one <span class="caps">URL</span> and then not find my bookmark notes again &#8211; even though I knew I was looking at the same item.  I figure that we could maintain a list of rules that allow you to turn any <span class="caps">URL</span> into its canonical version.  This wouldn&#8217;t be ebay specific.</p>

	<h3>A website with lots of info about swimming pools</h3>


	<p>I&#8217;ve found it quite hard to find swimming pools close to work in the past.  I&#8217;d like a site that has a map of all swimming pools in the local area along with info (opening times, costs) and reviews of those pools (when&#8217;s a good time to go).</p>
