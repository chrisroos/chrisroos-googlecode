  I use "exonetric":http://www.exonetric.com/ to host this "typo":http://www.typosphere.org instance.  It's on a "freebsd":http://www.freebsd.org virtual server so I have to maintain everything.  For a long time, I've been using "mysql":http://www.mysql.org 4.  This is fine apart from a problem during initial installation causing it not to start automatically on machine restart.  This meant that whenever the virtual machine was rebooted I had to manually restart mysql, which basically wouldn't happen until I actually noticed it - not cool.

  I spent the time today to upgrade to mysql 5.  Luckily this solved the auto start problem and mysql now comes up with the machine.

  Although incredibly interesting (hmm) that wasn't really the point of the post.  This is...  Since using freebsd I've always relied on "ports":http://www.freebsd.org/ports/ (instructions for compilation of software) for the installation of software.  When installing mysql today, I used the pre-compiled package binary instead.  I'm amazed at how much faster it is; and now really can't believe I've been bothering with the ports all this time.  I guess it was some kind of anal retentive control I thought I was getting by compiling the software myself; when infact I was only ever compiling with the default options and just wasting time...  Ho hum.

  Two moral's here me thinks.  Use packages if you don't know what you're doing (I don't).  Don't mess around with things you don't understand (manually deleting ports dir before un-installing ports and then expecting packages to just overwrite them.  Oh well, it seems ok).
