  div(notice). 28-Apr-2009.  This is now a firefox extension hosted at "addons.mozilla.org":https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/11664.
  
  I've wondered in the "past":http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ydn-delicious/message/1447 about sending "trackbacks":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trackback (or "pingbacks":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pingback) to bookmarked resources on "del.icio.us":http://del.icio.us.  As with most things, you can either wait for someone to do it for you, or you can do it yourself...  I started to investigate last Thursday afternoon and soon got sucked into the much more interesting issue of the missing "permalinks":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permalink for bookmarks.  You see, every time you bookmark something on del.icio.us, you are creating a new "resource":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer#REST.27s_Central_Principle:_Resources.  Unfortunately, it's a very sad :-( resource.  Sad because it doesn't have a "URL":http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL and so can't be linked to.  An anonymous resource floating around the world wide web looking for love.  Boo hoo.  Anyway, enough of that.  I figured that if we could assign a unique tag to each of these resources then they would, as a side effect, get a permalink (you can already get your bookmarks containing a given tag by using http://del.icio.us/USERNAME/MY_TAG).  I experimented with using the url as a tag.  Although there seem to be some limits on what you can use, I found that if you strip the protocol and trailing slash from a url you are generally OK.  So, if we bookmark "BBC News":http://news.bbc.co.uk and tag it with news.bbc.co.uk then we can access that individual bookmark at "http://del.icio.us/chrisjroos/news.bbc.co.uk":http://del.icio.us/chrisjroos/news.bbc.co.uk.

  As you can only bookmark the same URL once, it should guarantee that the url-tag is unique.  I can, however, see a problem with the trailing slash.  Although it's possible to bookmark URLs that differ only in the trailing slash (http://example.com/article1 and http://example.com/article1/ for example), it doesn't seem possible to create a tag that contains that same trailing slash.  OK, so we could always ensure that we remove the trailing slashes from the URLs we bookmark but that doesn't seem like a very robust solution.

  While experimenting, I found that I could use forward slashes within my tags, www.foo.com/bar/baz for example.  So, I started prepending url/ to my url-tag so that I could easily recognise posts that already had permalinks.  It was at this time that I noticed the similarity between the del.icio.us url history page del.icio.us/url/MD5_OF_URL (e.g. "BBC News":http://del.icio.us/url/4961e08b5118fbfddec7fb18fa303151) and my permalinked bookmark, del.icio.us/chrisjroos/url/URL.  If I was to "hash":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5 the bookmarked url in the same way as del.icio.us then I would end up with a url like del.icio.us/chrisjroos/url/MD5_OF_URL.  You can see the similarity in the URLs below.

  * "http://del.icio.us/chrisjroos/url/4961e08b5118fbfddec7fb18fa303151":http://del.icio.us/chrisjroos/url/4961e08b5118fbfddec7fb18fa303151
  * "http://del.icio.us/url/4961e08b5118fbfddec7fb18fa303151":http://del.icio.us/url/4961e08b5118fbfddec7fb18fa303151

  It looks as though it's part of del.icio.us itself doesn't it?  Cool huh.  It'd be really cool to extend the del.icio.us "firefox":http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/ "extension":https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1532 to automatically add this tag when bookmarking a site.

  I've created a crappy script that will add this url/MD5_OF_URL tag to each of your posts.  It's hosted on "google code":http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/delicious_url_tags and pasted below.  Err, use at your own risk by the way.

  <pre class="code ruby">
  USERNAME = 'YOUR_USERNAME'
  PASSWORD = 'YOUR_PASSWORD'
  POSTS_CACHE = 'FILE_TO_STORE_YOUR_EXISTING_DELICIOUS_POSTS_IN'

  # GET ALL POSTS
  unless File.exists?(POSTS_CACHE)
    puts "Downloading all posts..."
    curl_cmd = <<-EndCurl
  curl "https://api.del.icio.us/v1/posts/all" \
  -u"\#{USERNAME}:\#{PASSWORD}" \
  -s
  > \#{POSTS_CACHE}
    EndCurl
    `\#{curl_cmd}`
  end

  require 'hpricot'
  require 'md5'
  require 'cgi'

  def add_url_hash_to_post(post)
    url = CGI.unescapeHTML(post['href'])
    url_hash = MD5.md5(url)
    url = CGI.escape(url)

    tags = post['tag'].split(' ').collect { |tag| CGI.unescapeHTML(tag) }
    tags << "url/\#{url_hash}" unless tags.include?("url/\#{url_hash}")
    tags = tags.collect { |tag| CGI.escape(tag) }
    tags = tags.join(' ')

    shared = post['shared']
    description = CGI.escape(CGI.unescapeHTML(post['description']))
    extended = CGI.escape(CGI.unescapeHTML(post['extended']))

    curl_cmd = <<-EndCurl
  curl "https://api.del.icio.us/v1/posts/add" \
  -u"\#{USERNAME}:\#{PASSWORD}" \
  -d"url=\#{url}" \
  -d"description=\#{description}" \
  -d"extended=\#{extended}" \
  -d"tags=\#{tags}" \
  -d"shared=\#{shared}" \
  -s
    EndCurl
    `\#{curl_cmd}`
  end

  # ADD THE URL/<md5_hash> TAG TO EACH POST
  posts_xml = File.open(POSTS_CACHE) { |f| f.read }
  posts_doc = Hpricot(posts_xml)
  count = 1
  (posts_doc/'posts'/'post').each do |post_xml|
    puts "Bookmark: \#{count}" if (count % 5) == 0
    add_url_hash_to_post(post_xml.attributes)
    count += 1
  end
