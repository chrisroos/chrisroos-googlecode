  I've spent some time today looking into getting "Cyrus Imap":http://asg.web.cmu.edu/cyrus/ installed on "FreeBsd":http://www.freebsd.org 5.3R.

  I haven't got too far yet but think I've probably learned a few things I didn't know.

  Initially I just installed cyrus-imap from the ports and left it with all the default values.  Once I had this and played around a bit, I un-installed and started re-installing the "cyrus-sasl":http://asg.web.cmu.edu/sasl/ library manually, playing with various configuration options.

  When installed using the default options, all of the following 'plugins' are installed in .

  * liblogin
  * libanonymous
  * libcrammd5
  * libdigestmd5
  * libgssapiv2
  * libntlm
  * libotp
  * libplain
  * libsasldb

  My preference at this stage is to get the imap server running with plaintext passwords over a TLS encrypted pipe.  As such I started looking at the options available to <code>configure</code>.  Some of the options seem to be represented in the Makefile so my first approach was to 'disable' them on the command line.

  <pre class="code shell">
  $ make -DWITHOUT_OTP -DWITHOUT_CRAM -DWITHOUT_DIGEST -DWITHOUT_GSSAPI
  </pre>

  I also really wanted to disable anonymous access (which I could see how to do in the options in <code>configure</code> but not in the Makefile) but I ignored that for now.

  When installed, having been built with the above options, I had all of the above 'plugins' except the following.

  * libcrammd5
  * libdigestmd5
  * libgssapiv2
  * libotp

  This was better but I still had some 'plugins' that I didn't really want.  Once again, I un-installed the sasl port and this time built it passing arguments directly to <code>configure</code>.

  <pre class="code shell">
  $ make CONFIGURE_ARGS+='--disable-cram --disable-digest --disable-otp --disable-gssapi --disable-anon'
  </pre>

  This time I ended up with just the libplain and libsasldb 'plugins' which seems much closer to what I want - at least I think it does based on my very very limited knowledge at present.
