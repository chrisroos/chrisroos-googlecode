  We've just recently started poking our head above the radar at "work":http://www.reevoo.com regarding our 'new' (been around for a while but just undergone a re-design) review site - "Reevoo":http://www.reevoo.com.

  Take a look, why not.

  The main point of interest (for me) is that we are now aggregating reviews from blog entries.  I've been commuting a lot recently and have had plenty of time to read (check my "recent consumption":http://allconsuming.net/person/chrisjroos).  I'm more than happy to write reviews of these books but I really cannot be bothered to go over the "Amazon":http://www.amazon.co.uk, or anywhere else for that matter, to do so.  Now I don't have to; I can write the review right here and have it appear on any site that I can "notify":http://www.reevoo.com/web_services/manual_ping.  

  Cool huh.
