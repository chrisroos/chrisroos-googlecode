  By parsing the output of svn diff, we can concisely display the responsibilities that have been added/removed to various objects.  It is based on the assumption that our tests capture these changes.

  Taking a very simple (and partially made up) diff:

  <pre class="code ruby">
  Index: test/amount_test.rb
  ===================================================================
  --- test/amount_test.rb (revision 2)
  +++ test/amount_test.rb (working copy)
  @@ -2,9 +2,8 @@

   class AmountTest < Test::Unit::TestCase

  -  def test_should_format_amount
  -    formatted_amount = Amount.format(5, '$')
  -    assert_equal '$5.00', formatted_amount
  +  def test_should_flunk
  +    flunk
     end
  </pre>

  And piping it through the diff_parser, we get:

  <pre class="code">
  --- Amount
  + should flunk
  - should format amount
  </pre>

  The output is in a diff-like format so that we can pipe it straight into "TextMate":http://www.macromates.com and benefit from the colour formatting therein.

  h2. diff_parser.rb

  <pre class="code ruby">
  #!/usr/bin/env ruby

  class Test
    def initialize
      @added, @removed = [], []
    end
    def add_responsibility(responsibility)
      @added << responsibility
    end
    def remove_responsibility(responsibility)
      @removed << responsibility
    end
    def added_responsibilities
      (@added - @removed).sort
    end
    def removed_responsibilities
      (@removed - @added).sort
    end

    if line =~ /Index: (.*)/
      if (test_name = File.basename($1, '.rb')) =~ /_test$/
        name_of_class_under_test = test_name.sub(/_test/, '')
