  Well, having used "bloglines":http://www.bloglines.com "since":/blog/2005-10-02-online-news-reader the beginning of October, I've just replaced it with "rojo":http://www.rojo.com.  There were a couple of anoyances with bloglines - the main one being that if you click on a folder, all stories are marked as read.  I realise that you can go through and keep them unread but if you click on a folder that contains "digg":http://www.digg.com and "slashdot":http://www.slashdot.com, that's a lot of clicking when you might not have time right now.

  The main reason for switching to rojo is that it "works as I would expect it to work":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_surprise, particularly regarding the way in which stories are marked as read.  It also seems to offer lots of cool tagging/social features that I'm yet to explore.
