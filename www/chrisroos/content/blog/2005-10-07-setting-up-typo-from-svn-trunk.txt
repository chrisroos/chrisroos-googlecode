  This is for "Apache":http://httpd.apache.org 1.3 with "FastCgi":http://www.fastcgi.com, "Ruby":http://www.ruby-lang.org, "MySql":http://www.mysql.org 4 and "Subversion":http://subversion.tigris.org already installed on "FreeBsd":http://www.freebsd.org 4.11 Stable.

  <pre class="code">
  $ svn checkout svn://leetsoft.com/typo/trunk typo
  </pre>

  In the public directory, within the newly created typo directory, edit the dispatch.fcgi file, changing the #! (shebang) line to /usr/local/bin/ruby.

  Create a database for the typo install.

  <pre class="code">
  $ mysql
  mysql> create database typo;
  mysql> quit
  </pre>

  Copy the default database.yml.example file in config directory to database.yml.  Edit the file with the mysql credentials for your server.  Ignore (possibly remove) the development and test sections of the config file as these are not required in 'production'.

  Use the mysql script in the db directory to create database tables.

  <pre class="code">
  $ mysql -Dtypo < db/schema.mysql.sql
  </pre>

  *NB.* There is a mysql-v3 script as well.  As far as I can tell the only difference is the database engine (InnoDb by default and MyIsam in v3).

  Add a new FastCgiServer to the Apache config (httpd.conf).

  <pre class="code">
  FastCgiServer /home/web/typo/public/dispatch.fcgi -initial-env RAILS_ENV=production
  </pre>

  Add a virtual host for this new site.

  _To do_

  Restart apache.

  <pre class="code">
  $ apachectl graceful
  </pre>

That's it.
