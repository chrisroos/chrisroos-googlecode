  It's been on my list for quite a while to check out online newsreaders in order to replace my flagging "desktop client of choice":http://www.sharpreader.com.

  This has been pushed up the list by my recent contract taking me away from my main machine for the best part of the week.  As such, I spent last night looking at some of the alternatives listed on "this":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_news_aggregators#Online_news_aggregators "wikipedia":http://www.wikipedia.org article.

  I'm currently torn between "bloglines":http://www.bloglines.com and "blox0r":http://www.bloxor.com and although bloxor was slightly ahead last night I've actually been using bloglines more during the day today.

  Blox0r is a XUL(XML User interface Language) app which means that it only runs in Mozilla browsers (I think).  This provides for a very rich and clean interface which suits me perfectly.  Unfortunately, I'm just not 100% sure that it's doing exactly what I expect it to be doing - a handful of feeds are not rendering as they should which makes me wonder what else may not be working correctly.  Hence my current persuasion toward bloglines, which although looks a little too 'full featured' for my needs is at least rendering all of my feeds correctly.

  I also tested the following services last night, none of which seemed to come up to scratch.  Feed lounge actually looks very promising but is currently in a non public alpha so I'll have to wait a little longer on that one.

  * "bloogz":http://reader.bloogz.com - no opml import
  * "newsgator":http://www.newsgator.com - maybe too 'commercial' looking
  * "2rss":http://www.2rss.com - too complicated, didn't actually know what to do
  * "bean rocket":http://beanrocket.com - didn't import opml
  * "feed-tank":http://feed-tank.com - rails, no categories, didn't import correctly
  * "news is free":http://www.newsisfree.com - slightly too complicated
  * "rss-feed":http://www.rss-feed.org - no opml import
  * "rss freaks":http://www.rssfreaks.com - no opml import
  * "waggr":http://www.waggr.com - pretty good, slight interface problems, import opml but no categories
  * "feed lounge":http://www.feedlounge.com - looks good, still in alpha.
