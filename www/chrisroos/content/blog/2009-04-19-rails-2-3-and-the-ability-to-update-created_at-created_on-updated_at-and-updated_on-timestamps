summary:    There was a Rails 2.3 security note that suggested we could now set the AR timestamps.  It turns out we've always been able to set the created_at/on timestamps and that updated_at/on are also now assignable.

  The timing of the "automatically generated timestamps and attribute assignment in rails 2.3 security note":http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-security/browse_thread/thread/1d2fb5dc524f9ff4 [1] was interesting to me because I'd just spent a while really trying to get my head around "attr_accessible":http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html#M002226 and  "attr_protected":http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html#M002225 and the best way to test their effects in an app I was working on.  Although I intend to write about the testing separately, the conclusion I came to was that I wanted to test the behaviour (more specifically, I was interested in what I could/couldn't assign) of my objects and not that I was specifically using attr_accessible or attr_protected.
  
  Reading Alex's post made me wonder whether the "rails":http://rubyonrails.org/ "API":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API ever guaranteed that the timestamps would be readonly: If that was the case then I can see arguments for not wanting to test the behaviour of your objects (because you're essentially testing the framework itself).  I couldn't find any mention of whether they'd specifically be readonly so chose to do a bit of digging.  I created a "script":http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/scratch/rails_timestamps_test/ that allowed me to, with relative ease, run tests against rails apps created with different versions of rails.  Using this I was able to test the mass assignment of timestamps (created_at, created_on, updated_at and updated_on) against multiple versions of rails.  The conclusion I came to (and I'd love for other people to replicate my experiment and prove/disprove my results) was that the created_at and created_on pair of attributes have always (at least as far back as rails 1.0.0) been assignable, while the updated_at and updated_on attributes have only recently become assignable.  While digging I managed to find the "lighthouse ticket":https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/1612-cant-create-ar-models-with-custom-updated_xx-timestamp (#1612) that requested the ability to set the updated_* timestamps and the "rails commit":http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/63aac338332a06d3c9e28dde7954679703ec7620 that closed that ticket.

  * Get a copy of rails
  
  <pre class="code shell">
    $ cd /path/to/code
    $ git clone git://github.com/rails/rails.git
  </pre>
  
  * Create a "mysql":http://www.mysql.com/ database called rails_timestamps_test, and create a table within that database called people.
  
  <pre class="code sql">
    mysql> CREATE DATABASE rails_timestamps_test;
    mysql> USE rails_timestamps_test;
    mysql> CREATE TABLE people (id INTEGER AUTO_INCREMENT, created_on DATE, created_at DATETIME, updated_on DATE, updated_at DATETIME, PRIMARY KEY (id));

  * If you specify a tag of rails that is anything other than a 3 part version number (e.g. the four part version 2.3.2.1, or the release candidate 2.1.0_RC1) then the version test will fail because the Rails::VERSION constant only contains the MAJOR, MINOR and TINY components and that's what we use to check the version our app uses.
  
  * The supplied database.yml file assumes a mysql database running on localhost that has a root user with no password.  You can update this to reflect your actual environment.
  
  * The projects are created in /path/to/code/rails_timestamps_test/projects/ with a name like rails-app-x-x-x (major, minor, tiny).
  
  * In order to ensure we are testing against the correct version of rails, I symlink rails from /path/to/code/rails (after changing to the requested tag) into rails-app-x-x-x/vendor/rails.  The problem here is that if you re-run the script with a different rails version and then attempt to run a test from your first project that it will be using the recently specified version of rails.  Luckily, the rails_version_test will fail fast which means you shouldn't have to waste time wondering why something is not working as expected.
  
  * I wonder whether it'd be useful to extract the 'create a rails app from a specific version of rails' functionality out of this script?
