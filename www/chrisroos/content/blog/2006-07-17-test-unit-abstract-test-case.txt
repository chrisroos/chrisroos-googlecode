  Having found a "new way to structure my tests":/blog/2006-07-17-some-realisations-about-testing, the need for some common setup shared by multiple test cases became apparent.

  I think the traditional way to do this was to create a subclass of TestCase to contain the common setup code and then subclass that for your individual test cases.  This is fine, but in "test/unit":http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/test/unit/rdoc/index.html, a TestCase with no tests causes an error.

  One solution would be to use a module to contain the common setup and include that in your test case.

  <pre class="code ruby">
  module CommonSetup
    def setup
      @stack = Stack.new
    end
  end
  class MyTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
    include CommonSetup
    def test_should_accept_an_item_when_sent_push
      assert_nothing_raised { @stack.push(1) }
    end
  end
  </pre>

  Although this is fine, I spent a short while creating an AbstractTestCase that doesn't complain if no tests are specified.

  <pre class="code ruby">
  require 'test/unit'
  class Test::Unit::AbstractTestCase < Test::Unit::TestCase
    def default_test
      klass = self.class.to_s
      ancestors = (self.class.ancestors - [self.class]).collect { |ancestor| ancestor.to_s }
      super unless klass =~ /AbstractTestCase/ or ancestors.first =~ /AbstractTestCase/
    end
  end
  </pre>

  Any test case (TestBase in this example) that inherits from AbstractTestCase can now contain setup and teardown methods but not have to worry about missing tests.  In order to maintain expected behaviour, any test case subclassed from TestBase will still complain if tests are missing.

  <pre class="code ruby">
  class TestBase < Test::Unit::AbstractTestCase
    # 'No test were specified' error is not thrown
    def setup
      @bar = { :foo => 123 }
    end
  end
  class RealTest < TestBase
    # Utilises TestBase#setup
    def test_example
      assert_equal 123, @bar[:foo]
    end
  end
  class ShouldErrorTest < TestBase
    # 'No tests were specified' error
  end
  </pre>

  I then figured that you may want more than one level of abstract test case, i.e. be able to define at the TestCase class level whether or not a test case was abstract.  This isn't properly tested but it seems to work ok.

  *Note* This isn't doing exactly what I thought (the default test case is default_test, not test_default).  This works because it just creates an empty test in your test case.  This breaks behaviour in test cases that subclass your abstract test case as they too will already have at least one test defined.

  <pre class="code ruby">
  require 'test/unit'
  class Test::Unit::TestCase
    class << self
      def abstract
        self.class_eval do
          def test_default
          end
        end
      end
    end
  end
  </pre>

  By sending the abstract message to any TestCase class, no errors will be reported when no tests are specified.  It does this by overriding the test_default method; which is the method that raises the error if no other tests are specified.

  <pre class="code ruby">
  class AbstractTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
    abstract
    # 'No test were specified' error is not thrown
  end
  class NormalTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
    # 'No test were specified' error
  end
  </pre>
