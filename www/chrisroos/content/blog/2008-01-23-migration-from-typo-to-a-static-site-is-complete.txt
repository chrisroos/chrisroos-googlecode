  I'm tired so I'll keep this short...  If you can see this post then it means that I haven't broken anything (well, it means I haven't broken the rss feed anyway).  I still have lots to do but "eating my own dogfood":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eat_one's_own_dog_food should give me a reason to keep improving.
