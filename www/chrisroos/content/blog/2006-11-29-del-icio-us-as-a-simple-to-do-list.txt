  I often come across resources on the web that I'm interested in but want to look at in more detail later.  I currently use a combination of: storing urls in text files, placing links in my "backpack":http://www.backpackit.com, storing bookmarks in my browser and, in the past, tagging links with "to_read":http://del.icio.us/tag/to_read in "del.icio.us":http://del.icio.us.  I inevitably end up forgetting where I've stored these 'bookmarks' and therefore miss out on that resource[1].  In an attempt to consolidate places I can hide information, I've created a todo bundle in del.icio.us that currently contains the to_watch and to_read tags.  Doing that today ensured that I remembered to watch a "great presentation":http://www.identity20.com/media/OSCON2005/ by "Dick Hardt":http://blame.ca/dick/ on the subject of "identity 2.0":http://www.identity20.com.  Cool.

  fn1. You could probably argue that because I forget about the resource, I can't have been _that_ interested in the first place...
