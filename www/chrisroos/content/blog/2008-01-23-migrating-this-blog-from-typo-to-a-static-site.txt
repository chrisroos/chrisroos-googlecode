  I'm in the process of migrating this site from "typo":http://www.typosphere.org/ to a bunch of static pages.  I aim to get the static site deployed this evening.  I'll post again when I've migrated.  If any RSS subscribers out there don't see a new post this evening, or tomorrow morning, then it means that I've failed to get it deployed or that it's deployed and I've screwed up.... That's all for now.

  Oh and the code is in the "usual place":http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/migrate-typo-to-static-site/ if you fancy following along.
