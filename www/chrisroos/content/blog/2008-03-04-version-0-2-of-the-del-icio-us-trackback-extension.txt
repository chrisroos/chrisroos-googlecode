  I finally got round to compiling the "del.icio.us trackback extension":/blog/2008-02-04-sending-trackbacks-to-the-sites-that-you-bookmark-in-del-icio-us I wrote about a while back.

  You can install it from the installation.html[1] page on the "del.icio.us trackbacks google group":http://groups.google.com/group/delicious-trackbacks.  Feel free to use that group to post any questions you have too.

  Current features:

  * Scans the html of the page you're bookmarking looking for a link (anchor) with a rel attribute whose value is trackback.
  * Sends a request to the trackback URI if it was found.
  * Records (by adding the 'dtb-sent' tag) the sending of the trackback so that we can avoid sending multiple trackbacks to the same site.
  * Records the success ('dtb-success' tag) or failure ('dtb-failure') of the trackback request.

  That's all for now.

  fn1. I don't appear to be able to link directly to that page which is a bit odd.
