  A mate's laptop was making very strange noises.  I wondered if dust could be causing the 'interference' and so took the laptop apart to clean.  Although it didn't look too dirty, it seems to have done the trick.  Photos of the re-assembly are on "flickr":http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/sets/72157600007191066/.
