  I've tried to sell these books on the Amazon marketplace multiple times in the past.  Although I've managed to sell some through Amazon, usually at a loss, these ones just haven't gone.  I don't want them, I'm not going to throw them and I'd rather someone had them if they were going to be useful.  So, if you see something you want "email me":mailto:chris@seagul.co.uk, pop something useful in the subject line and it's yours.  Oh, I'll need you to cover the cost of postage, which for these sort of books is going to be around £6 (give or take) by paypal (or possibly something else if it's easy).

  They're all in good/great condition apart from the Beginning Visual C# book which is the only one I've really read properly.
