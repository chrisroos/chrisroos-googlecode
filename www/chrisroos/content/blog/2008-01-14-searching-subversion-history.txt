  I've often felt the need to search through our "subversion":http://subversion.tigris.org/ repository to find, for example, when a method was removed/renamed.  As far as I'm aware there's no easy way to do this using the standard subversion, or "trac":http://trac.edgewall.org/, tools.  A few days ago the need arose once more: I wanted to know when a particular class had stopped being used within our codebase.  It struck me that if I had a "diff":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff file for each changeset that I'd be able to "grep":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep for the change I was looking for.  I hacked together a script to produce a diff of each changeset (actually, as I knew when the class was added, I only produced a diff for a subset of the changesets) and was able to find the information I needed.  The script is pasted below and on "google code":http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/svn_changesets/.  It assumes that you are running it from within an svn working direction.  It took a while to produce the diff files (I'm afraid I don't have any stats) but the result was a really fast way of finding, otherwise hard to find, information.  I guess it'd be quite easy to automate the diff creation process so that you had an always up-to-date bunch of diff fies...

  Is this useful, or have I missed something obvious in Subversion or Trac that does exactly this?

  <pre class="code ruby">
  require 'fileutils'

  stop_at_revision = ARGV[0]
  raise "Please specify the revision that you wish to go back to as the only argument to this script." unless stop_at_revision
  stop_at_revision = Integer(stop_at_revision)

  class Time
    def friendly_format
      strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    end
  end

  def msg(message)
    puts "\#{Time.now.friendly_format} - \#{message}"
  end

  def produce_diff(revisions, earlier_revision = nil)
    if revisions.empty?
      msg "All finished."
      exit
    end

    later_revision = earlier_revision ? earlier_revision : revisions.shift
    earlier_revision = revisions.shift

    msg "Creating diff from revision \#{earlier_revision} to \#{later_revision}."
    `svn diff -r\#{earlier_revision}:\#{later_revision} > patches/\#{later_revision}.patch`
    produce_diff(revisions, earlier_revision)
  end

  FileUtils.mkdir_p 'patches'

  msg "Scanning output of svn log to find all revisions that we care about..."
  log = `svn log -rHEAD:\#{stop_at_revision} -q`
  revisions = log.scan(/^r(\d+)/)
  revisions = revisions.flatten.collect { |revision| Integer(revision) }

  produce_diff(revisions)
  </pre>
