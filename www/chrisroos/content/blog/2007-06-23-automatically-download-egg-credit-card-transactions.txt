  I've followed in my "previous":/blog/2007-05-14-automatically-downloading-my-recent-transactions-from-lloyds-tsb "footsteps":/blog/2007-05-04-automatically-downloading-my-most-recent-hsbc-transactions and automated the download of my "egg":http://egg.com credit card transactions and statements.  Using this in combination with my "ofx convertor":/blog/2007-04-01-converting-egg-credit-card-statements-to-ofx-for-upload-to-wesabe makes it easier for me to upload my financial data to "wesabe":http://www.wesabe.com.

  As always, the code is in "google code":http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/egg/ and pasted below for your viewing pleasure...

  <pre class="code ruby">
  require 'egg-credentials'

  def execute_curl(cmd)
    `\#{cmd}`
  end

  COOKIE_LOCATION = "/tmp/egg.cookie"
  STATEMENT_DATE = '18 January 2007'

  RECENT_TRANSACTIONS_FILE = '/Users/chrisroos/Desktop/egg-recent-transactions.html'
  STATEMENT_FILE = '/Users/chrisroos/Desktop/egg-statement.html'

  # Logging in requires a cookie that is set when we first visit the login page
  curl_cmd = %[curl -s -c"\#{COOKIE_LOCATION}" "https://new.egg.com/security/customer/logon?URI=https://new.egg.com/customer/youraccounts"]
  execute_curl curl_cmd

  # POST our login credentials
  curl_cmd = %[curl -s -b"\#{COOKIE_LOCATION}" -c"\#{COOKIE_LOCATION}" -L "https://logon.egg.com/LoginWebServer/services/CustomerLogin" -d"firstName=\#{FIRST_NAME}" -d"lastName=\#{LAST_NAME}" -d"dobDay=\#{DOB_DAY}" -d"dobMonth=\#{DOB_MONTH}" -d"dobYear=\#{DOB_YEAR}" -d"postcode=\#{POSTCODE}" -d"mmn=\#{MOTHERS_MAIDEN_NAME}" -d"password=\#{PASSWORD}" -d"HiddenURI=https%3A%2F%2Fnew.egg.com%2Fcustomer%2Fyouraccounts"]
  execute_curl curl_cmd

  # List and save recent transactions
  curl_cmd = %[curl -s -o"\#{RECENT_TRANSACTIONS_FILE}" -b"\#{COOKIE_LOCATION}" "https://your.egg.com/customer/eggcard/recenttransactions.aspx"]
  execute_curl curl_cmd

  # There is no sensible way to get your statements.  I'd hope for something like /statements/18-jun-2007.html but no such luck
  # Instead, there is a zero indexed array of statement dates.  Selecting one of these statement dates allows us to construct
  # a uri using the index of the date in the list.  So, if 18 June 2007 is the first date in the list (i.e. index 0) then we can view that
  # statement at https://your.egg.com/customer/eggcard/statements.aspx?index=0
  # Interestingly, this is how it works from the recent transactions page, from any actual statement page, it appears that this is
  # too hard (it's not) and instead the developers have resorted to using some magical .net/javascript voodoo to obtain a different
  # statement.
  require 'rubygems'
  require 'hpricot'

  recent_transactions = File.open(RECENT_TRANSACTIONS_FILE) { |f| f.read }
  doc = Hpricot(recent_transactions)
  statement_dates = []
  (doc/'select#ctl01_content_recenttransactions_lstPreviousStatements/option').each { |e| statement_dates << e.inner_text }
  statement_index = statement_dates.index(STATEMENT_DATE)

  curl_cmd = %[curl -s -o"\#{STATEMENT_FILE}" -b"\#{COOKIE_LOCATION}" "https://your.egg.com/customer/eggcard/statements.aspx?index=\#{statement_index}"]
  execute_curl curl_cmd
