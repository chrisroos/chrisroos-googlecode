:body: A side effect of my "del.icio.us":http://del.icio.us "bookmarks":http://del.icio.us/chrisjroos having "permalinks":http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2007/09/05/patching-the-del-icio-us-firefox-extension-to-add-permalinks is that you can, if you really really want, 'comment' on them.  You just need to bookmark (in del.icio.us) my permalinked bookmark, write a comment in the notes field and tag it for:chrisjroos.  One small step to people being able to comment on anything they see (just an idea I've had bubbling for a while).
