  Continuing from the "previous post":http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2006/02/23/rails-testing-without-database, it appears that the rake testing tasks are also tightly coupled to active record.
  
  This feels quite dirty, but I've managed to get round it by manipulating the tasks from the outside (they are buried in the rails libs).
  
  To replicate, create a new file called 'default.rake' in the lib/tasks/ directory within your rails project, and paste in the following code.
  
  <typo:code lang="ruby">
  Rake::Task::TASKS.delete('default')
  Rake::Task[:test_units].instance_variable_set(:@prerequisites, [])
  Rake::Task[:test_functional].instance_variable_set(:@prerequisites, [])
  
  task :default do
    Rake::Task[:test_units].invoke      rescue got_error = true
    Rake::Task[:test_functional].invoke rescue got_error = true
    raise "Test failures" if got_error
  end
  </typo:code>
  
  Because this relies on the internal implementation of rake (instance variable names and TASKS constant) it might well do very bad things to versions that aren't 0.6.2.

  Just realised that I don't need most of the code above.  All you actually need in default.rake is as follows.  Stoopid Chris.
  
  <typo:code lang="ruby">
  Rake::Task[:test_units].instance_variable_set(:@prerequisites, [])
  Rake::Task[:test_functional].instance_variable_set(:@prerequisites, [])
  </typo:code>
