  I'm almost 100% certain that there's a "bug":http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/247143372 in the Hsbc Internet Banking site.
  
  My account is overdrawn yet the balance shows as positive when I download my transactions in either 'Money 98 onwards (ofx)' or 'Quicken 2002 (ofx)'.  I believe that section 3.2.9.2 of the "Ofx":http://www.ofx.net 2.1.1 spec explains that these balances should be shown as negative.
  
  I've tried to "email":http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=31365693@N00&q=hsbc+AND+ofx&m=tags and I've "tried":http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/279942352 "to":http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/279956472 "call":http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/313632312 "hsbc":http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/313656682.  Both to no avail.
  
  Does anyone know anyone that works at Hsbc and might be able to get a message to someone in development?  If not, what's the etiquette on facebook groups?  I notice that there a few hsbc groups - can I just post messages to them asking for help?
  
  I've gotten so used to dealing with "real":http://www.wesabe.com companies that I'd forgotten how the old world works.

  :body: Chris- if there's anything we can do to fix things on the Wesabe end, let me know. Once your account is no longer overdrawn, things should be fine on our site, as we work backwards from the most recent balance. We could always correct the bad balances manually in the database, too.
