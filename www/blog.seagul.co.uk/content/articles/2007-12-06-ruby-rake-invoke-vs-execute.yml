:title: Ruby Rake - Invoke vs Execute
:body: |-
  First up - I don't know an awful lot about the magic that is "Rake":http://rake.rubyforge.org/.  As such, this is probably common knowledge to most people.
  
  I discovered the difference when trying to execute the db:migrate task from within another rake task (I already knew it worked when declared as a dependency).
  
  <typo:code lang="ruby">
  # Rakefile
  task :foo do
    Rake::Task['db:migrate'].execute
  end
  
  #$ rake foo
  #=> rake aborted!
  #=> uninitialized constant ActiveRecord
  </typo:code>
  
  I changed "Task#execute":http://rake.rubyforge.org/classes/Rake/Task.html#M000100 to "Task#invoke":http://rake.rubyforge.org/classes/Rake/Task.html#M000098 and, voila, it all worked fine.  The rdoc for those methods is actually pretty self explanatory, having seen the differences in action.  Oh well.
  
  I put together a simple example to demonstrate the differences.
  
  <typo:code lang="ruby">
  # The task (task_1) and its dependency (to_be_run_before_task_1)
  
  task :to_be_run_before_task_1 do
    puts "to_be_run_before_task_1"
  end
  
  task :task_1 => ['to_be_run_before_task_1'] do
    puts "task_1"
  end
  
  # Three tasks that 'run' task_1
  
  task :invoke_task_1 do
    Rake::Task['task_1'].invoke
  end
  
  task :execute_task_1 do
    Rake::Task['task_1'].execute
  end
  
  task :run_task_1_using_dependencies => ['task_1']
  
  # 'Running' the tasks
  
  #$ rake task_1
  #=> to_be_run_before_task_1
  #=> task_1
  
  #$ rake invoke_task_1
  #=> to_be_run_before_task_1
  #=> task_1
  
  #$ rake execute_task_1
  #=> task_1 #*** Note that the dependencies are not run
  
  #$ rake run_task_1_using_dependencies
  #=> to_be_run_before_task_1
  #=> task_1
  </typo:code>
