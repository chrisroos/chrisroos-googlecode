  On Thursday, "James":http://blog.floehopper.org/ and I spent some time investigating remote pairing options.  One tiny part of that investigation was finding a way to keep two remote filesystems in sync.  I initially thought of using "rsync":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync at regular intervals with "cron":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron.  Unless I've missed something, the smallest interval between cron jobs is one minute which is potentially too long.  We wanted a way to rsync (or sync in general) whenever the filesystem changed.  A little searching brought this "fslogger":http://www.kernelthread.com/software/fslogger/ tool to my attention.  It simply writes some event details to STDOUT every time something changes on the filesystem.  I figured that we could use this, with a little bit of ruby glue, to trigger rsync.  Our glue script continuously reads from STDIN, tries to match some pre-defined patterns and triggers rsync if those patterns are matched.  It's very brittle but it gets the job done.  Well, actually, it only partially gets the job done: I'm very unfamiliar with rsync but it seemed to take between 10 and 30 seconds to sync even if only one file had changed.  I suspect that I may have been doing something wrong though.

  <pre class="code ruby">
  #!/usr/bin/env ruby

  REMOTE_SERVER = 'YOUR_REMOTE_SERVER'
  REMOTE_PATH = 'YOUR_REMOTE_PATH'

  DIRECTORY_PATTERN = ARGV.delete_at(0)
  raise "You must specify a directory_pattern" unless DIRECTORY_PATTERN

  def rsync!
    `rsync -rz \#{File.join(DIRECTORY_PATTERN, '*')} \#{REMOTE_SERVER}:\#{REMOTE_PATH}`
  end

  while line=gets
    if line =~ /FSE_ARG_VNODE/ # CREATE FILE OR DIR
      rsync! if line[/path\s+=(.*)/, 1].strip =~ Regexp.new(DIRECTORY_PATTERN)
    elsif line =~ /FSE_ARG_STRING/ # REMOVE FILE OR DIR
      rsync! if line[/string\s+=(.*)/, 1].strip =~ Regexp.new(DIRECTORY_PATTERN)
    end
  end
  </pre>
