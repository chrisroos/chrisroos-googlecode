  I bought the "Skypephone":http://www.skype.com/intl/en/allfeatures/3skypephone/ from "three":http://three.co.uk about a week ago.  I haven't managed to get my number transfered yet and as such I haven't really used it in anger, but thought I'd write some random notes anyway.

  I didn't get off too a good start with "Skype":http://www.skype.com "not working":http://3skypephone.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=154 on the phone for two or three days after purchase.  Although Skype now works fine, it doesn't seem to remember my password, which makes it a bit of a pain each time you want to log in.  I've used skype for text chatting but haven't actually used it for voice yet so can't comment on the quality.

  The phone is an "AMOI":http://www.amoi.com (I'm not 100% sure that's the correct site as this phone doesn't appear there) WP-S1.  It feels remarkably similar to "Nokia":http://www.nokia.com phones I've used in the past.  In fact, the only difference I've found so far is the keys you press to lock the keypad (star then top-left button, rather than top-left button then start).

  If you try to visit a website beginning with www then a popup appears telling you that you'll be charged for data used.  If you visit a website that doesn't start www (e.g. "m.twitter.com":http://m.twitter.com) then you don't get this message.  This made me wonder whether I was still being charged for the data I was using - I guess I must be, right?

  I've connected the phone to my computer successfully using bluetooth and used it to transfer some "photos":http://flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/sets/72157603224666780/ I took yesterday with the 2 megapixel camera.

  I think I should be able to use the phone as a modem but the supplied CD contains Windows only software.

  Hmm, that's about all for now I think.
