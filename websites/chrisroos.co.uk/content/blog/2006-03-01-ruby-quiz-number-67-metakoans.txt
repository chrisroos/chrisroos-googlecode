  I just finished my first "rubyquiz":http://www.rubyquiz.com.  Yay.  I take a look every now and then but never seem to find the time to spend on them.

  I made the time for "metakoans":http://rubyquiz.com/quiz67.html as it involved 'meta-programming' which I've recently spent some time on at "work":http://www.reevoo.com

  My solution is here, and although it passes all the tests of the quiz it's probably not great as this stuff still confuses me somewhat.  I didn't take a look at any other solutions (although I will shortly) so any similarity is coincidental.

  <pre class="code ruby">
  class Object

    def attribute(arg, &block)

      if arg.class == Hash
        attribute = arg.keys[0]
        value = arg.values[0]
      else
        attribute = arg
        value = block ? block : nil
      end

      class_eval do

        attr_writer attribute

        define_method(attribute) do
          unless instance_variable_get("@\#{attribute}")
            default_value = (value.class == Proc) ? instance_eval(&value) : value
            instance_variable_set("@\#{attribute}", default_value)
          end
          instance_variable_get("@\#{attribute}")
        end

        define_method("\#{attribute}?") do
          instance_variable_get("@\#{attribute}") ? true : false
        end

      end

    end

  end
