  To aid my development of the "del.icio.us trackbacks firefox extension":/blog/2008-03-04-version-0-2-of-the-del-icio-us-trackback-extension I created a reference "trackback":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trackback server implementation based on the "trackback specification":http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/docs/trackback_spec.

  It's written in "Ruby":http://www.ruby-lang.org as a "Mongrel":http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/ handler and stores the trackbacks serialized to "YAML":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML on the filesystem.  The code is over in "my google code repository":http://code.google.com/p/chrisroos/ (no direct link as I plan to move the trackback-server from its current home in /trunk/scratch to /trunk/www/trackbacks.seagul.co.uk).

  On the off-chance that someone else might find it useful I'm currently hosting it at "http://trackbacks.seagul.co.uk":http://trackbacks.seagul.co.uk.  You might use it to see the del.icio.us trackbacks extension in action or to test the sending of trackbacks from your blog (the trackback URL is "http://trackbacks.seagul.co.uk/trackback":http://trackbacks.seagul.co.uk/trackback).  Or, you could just play with it using "curl":http://curl.haxx.se.

  <pre class="code shell">
  # Let's just try to GET the trackback URL
  $ curl http://trackbacks.seagul.co.uk/trackback
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
  <response>
    <error>1</error>
    <message>Http Method MUST be POST</message>
  </response>

  # OK, so we'll POST to the trackback URL
  $ curl http://trackbacks.seagul.co.uk/trackback -X"POST"
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
  <response>
    <error>1</error>
    <message>Content-Type MUST be 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' with OPTIONAL character encoding</message>
  </response>

  # Posting with the correct Content-Type
  $ curl http://trackbacks.seagul.co.uk/trackback -X"POST" -H"Content-Type: application/x-wencoded"
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
  <response>
    <error>1</error>
    <message>You MUST send the URL of your post (permalink) that mentions this post.</message>
  </response>

  # Post with the correct Content-Type and the required URL parameter to actually have a trackback created on the server
  $ curl http://trackbacks.seagul.co.uk/trackback -X"POST" -H"Content-Type: application/x-wencoded" -d"url=http://example.com"
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
  <response>
    <error>0</error>
  </response>
  </pre>
