  *Update Tue Apr 10th* Maybe "google":http://maps.google.com/help/maps/userguide/index.html read my question.

  The "news":http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6521295.stm of the very, very, very fast train in France made me wonder how one of my "regular routes":http://www.wayfaring.com/maps/show/35440 compared.

  At the time I travel, the journey takes 2 hours 10 minutes.  So, 130 minutes to travel 84 miles.  That'll be about 38 miles an hour then.  Brilliant.

  Actually, does anyone know of any sites (like wayfaring) where I might plot some points on a map and get either a "georss":http://www.georss.org/ or "kml":http://earth.google.com/kml/ feed of the data?  I like "wayfaring":http://www.wayfaring.com an' all, but it'd be nice to be able to separate the route data from their site.
