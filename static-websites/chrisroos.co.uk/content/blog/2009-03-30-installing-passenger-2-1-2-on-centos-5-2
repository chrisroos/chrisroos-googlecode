  I needed to upgrade "Passenger":http://www.modrails.com/ on our web server last week (so that we could run "Rails":http://rubyonrails.org/ 2.3 apps) but ran into a little problem getting it installed.
  
  We're running "CentOS":http://www.centos.org/ 5.2 on our staging server.
  
  <pre class="code shell">
    [root@rails-staging0 ~]# cat /etc/redhat-release 
    CentOS release 5.2 (Final)
  </pre>
  
  The passenger gem installed OK but when I ran passenger-install-apache2-module I got the following error.
  
  <pre class="code shell">
    ... other lines snipped ...
    
    /usr/bin/ld: skipping incompatible /usr/lib/libaprutil-1.so when searching for -laprutil-1
    /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -laprutil-1
    collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
    rake aborted!

    /var/ruby-enterprise-1.8.6-20080810/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/passenger-2.1.2/Rakefile:157
    (See full trace by running task with --trace)

    --------------------------------------------
    It looks like something went wrong
  </pre>
  
  Searching for this error didn't yield any definite fixes but a couple of posts mentioned re-installing the apr-devel packages.  I tried apr-devel to begin with but was told that it was already up-to-date.
  
  <pre class="code shell">
    [root@rails-staging0 ~]# yum install apr-devel
    ... other lines snipped ...
    Nothing to do
  </pre>
  
  I can't remember why but I tried apr-util-devel next which did result in the package being installed.
  
  <pre class="code shell">
    [root@rails-staging0 ~]# yum install apr-util-devel
    ... other lines snipped ...
    Installed: apr-util-devel.x86_64 0:1.2.7-7.el5
    Complete!
  </pre>
  
  With this package re-installed I was able to go ahead and install the passenger apache module (i.e. passenger-install-apache2-module succeeded).
  
  One slightly interesting/odd thing was that "yum":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_dog_Updater,_Modified reported that the same version (1.2.7-7.el5) of apr-util-dev was already installed.  The only difference after the re-install was that its status changed from 'base' to 'installed'.
  
  <pre class="code shell">
    # before the re-install
    [root@rails-staging0 ~]# yum list | grep apr-util-devel
    apr-util-devel.x86_64                    1.2.7-7.el5            base
    
    # after the re-install
    [root@rails-staging0 ~]# yum list | grep apr-util-devel
    apr-util-devel.x86_64                    1.2.7-7.el5            installed
  </pre>
