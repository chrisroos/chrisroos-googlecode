  The first is to ensure two arrays contain the same elements not necessarily in the same order.

  <pre class="code ruby">
  require 'test/unit'

  require 'set'
  module AssertEqualArray

    def assert_equal_array(array_1, array_2)
      assert_equal array_1.size, array_2.size, "Arrays must be of the same size to be equal"
      assert_equal array_1.to_set, array_2.to_set
    end

  end

  class Test::Unit::TestCase
    include AssertEqualArray
  end

  class MyTest < Test::Unit::TestCase

    def test_should_assert_equal_arrays
      assert_equal_array [1, 2, 3], [2, 1, 3]
    end

  end
  </pre>

  The second is to test for generated warnings.  In my "current project":/blog/2006-10-06-recording-daily-spending-with-a-ruby-dsl app, I use method_missing and wanted to warn the user if the unknown message looks like it's supposed to be a payment mechanism...

  <pre class="code ruby">
  day '25-oct-2006' do
    cash 30.29, beer
  end

  # Results in NoMethodError and, more importantly, this friendly warning..
  # Maybe you expected 'cash' to be a payment mechanism?
  # Cool huh?
  </pre>

  Anyway, I wanted a way to test that the warning was being generated and came up with another assertion...

  <pre class="code ruby">
  require 'test/unit'

  require 'stringio'
  module AssertWarning

    def assert_warning(expected_warning, &blk)
      original_stderr = $stderr
      $stderr = stderr = StringIO.new
      yield
      assert_equal expected_warning, stderr.string.chomp
    ensure
      $stderr = original_stderr
    end

  end

  class Test::Unit::TestCase
    include AssertWarning
  end

  class MyTest < Test::Unit::TestCase

    def test_should_assert_warning
      assert_warning('this is a warning') { Kernel::warn('this is a warning') }
    end

  end
  </pre>
