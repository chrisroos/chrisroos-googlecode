  OK, so I was made redundant from "reevoo":http://www.reevoo.com just over a week ago and my initial holiday mood is now wearing off.  I have a couple of things to follow up but I definitely don't have anything concrete so I'm putting this out there on the off chance someone wants to employ me (permanent or contract).

  This is a direct copy of an email I sent someone when they requested a CV.  It's not very comprehensive but it hopefully gives some indication of what I'm able to do.

  h2. Employment

  I spent just over three years at "reevoo.com":http://www.reevoo.com, until being made redundant on Monday 8th Dec 2008.

  h2. Skills

  * "Ruby":http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/.  A splendid little language.
  * "Rails":http://www.rubyonrails.org/.  Although I started using Rails in August 2005, I've definitely missed out on some of the more recent changes.
  * "Javascript":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript.  Should only be used to enhance existing functionality and should (probably) never be _required_ for a site.
  * "Testing":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing.  I'm completely sold on testing at all levels ("test/unit":http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/test/unit/rdoc/ up to "selenium":http://seleniumhq.org/, or an equivalent).
  * "CSS":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets.  I'm not brilliant with CSS and although I can get reasonable results it'll take me longer than it would someone that really knows their stuff.
  * "HTML":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML.  I love clean and semantically marked up HTML.
  * "Pair Programming":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming.  I prefer to pair program, particularly on production code.

  h2. Desired workplace

  * I want to work with smart people.
  * I want to work on software that has a purpose I believe in.
  * I want to work somewhere that I'm able to question decisions and have my questions listened to.
  * I want to work with open source software.
  * I want to contribute back to the open source community.

  h2. Likes

  * Simple solutions ("apache":http://httpd.apache.org/ and "webby":http://webby.rubyforge.org/ over a rails app, for example).
  * Learning and sharing knowledge.
  * Prioritising by always working on the next most important thing
  * Helping people through technology
  * The disruptive nature of technology

  h2. Dislikes

  * "SEO":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization. In my opinion, it's as simple as doing the right thing (follow web standards, provide something useful and think about the user).
  * Websites that don't get the web ("activeplaces.com":http://activeplaces.com, "nationalrail.co.uk":http://nationalrail.co.uk)
  * Websites that are poorly marked up, therefore making scraping them hard :-) (particularly bank websites)
